PPC Codename: Criptonic

Context:
The effects of doing recreational activities on one’s own mental health are almost priceless in the medical field. With a quick Google search, you can find countless studies stretching back decades on how doing recreational activities can improve one’s life. We don’t think it should be hard to have access to this kind of life and by connecting qualified people for the right people we could do wonders for not only the disabled population but the surrounding community too.we also want to put emphasis on friendship and not a client with a customer. This is purely a mutual experience with two people having a fun time.

This is intended to be a 501(c) non-profit.

Hypothesis:
By creating a central location for charities to showcase their events and people who enjoy working those events with the disabled community. We hope to encourage regularly scheduled recreational activities outside of these events. We want to encourage friendship and trustworthiness between two people in the name of better mental health.

Target Audience:
Disabled:
Care facilities
Adaptive rehabs
Local charities
Adaptive gyms
Hospitals
Vocational rehabilitation programs
Nondisabled:
Local charities
Medical students
Therapist
Service animal workers
Family

Onboarding qualified non-disabled people:
We plan to use already in place recreational therapy charities local to the Phoenix and Arizona area. Potentially, we could reach out to nursing schools and therapy schools for volunteers. Facilities such as Ability 360 will be crucial to the success of this.

Problem:
Being someone who has been disabled for his entire life, a common problem I have faced is finding someone whom I feel comfortable with to do recreational activities. This person generally does not need to be highly qualified in the medical field but to be acquainted with it. With this application, we hope to connect someone who has experience working with disabilities to someone who is disabled.

With this app though, we want to stress a mutually shared experience. The nondisabled person is not there just to ensure safety and supervision! We are looking for shared interest and mutual enjoyment from shared experience.

Real-life examples and use cases:
Daily walks to get out of the house and/or care facility.
Finding someone trustworthy enough to go to a concert with.
Pokémon Go events.
Checking out a local museum or park.

How is this being solved already:
Local charities have events planned.
We plan to centralize this and potentially get into the view of more people.
Facebook and other social media platforms.
This usually involves being a part of certain groups. We plan to have a vetting process for onboarding nondisabled people. In hopes that it will make it safer than trusting someone on Facebook.
